# Weather_App

A weather application created using Google's Flutter. The data is fetched from https://openweathermap.org/ and displayed in Celsius or Fahrenheit. It supports user localization, as well as, autocomplete for all supported cities around the world. The list of weather cards is expandable, and deleting them is as easy as sliding the card off the screen.
